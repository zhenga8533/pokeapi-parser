# PokéDB Data

This branch stores the structured JSON data generated by the `PokéDB` tool, which resides on the `main` branch of this repository.

The data here is automatically updated on a weekly basis via a GitHub Actions workflow.

## Data Sources

This dataset is a comprehensive aggregation of information from two primary sources:

- **PokéAPI**: Used as the foundational source for most Pokémon-related data.
- **Pokémon DB**: Scraped to gather and apply historical changes to ensure data is accurate for older generations.

## Data Structure

The data is organized into generation-specific folders (e.g., `gen1`, `gen9`). Each folder contains an `index.json` with summary data and subdirectories for detailed JSON files (`pokemon`, `ability`, `item`, etc.).

## Use as a Static API

The data on this branch can be accessed directly via HTTP, allowing you to use it as a simple, free, and static JSON API.

For detailed information on endpoints, data structures, and usage examples, please see the [**API Documentation**](https://github.com/zhenga8533/pokedb/wiki/API-Documentation) page on the project's wiki.
