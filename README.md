# Pokémon Data

This branch stores the structured JSON data generated by the Pokémon Data Collector tool, which resides on the `main` branch of this repository.

The data here is automatically updated on a weekly basis via a GitHub Actions workflow.

## Data Sources

This dataset is a comprehensive aggregation of information from two primary sources:

* **PokéAPI**: Used as the foundational source for most Pokémon-related data.
* **Pokémon DB**: Scraped to gather and apply historical changes to ensure data is accurate for older generations.

## Data Structure

The data on this branch is organized by Pokémon generation.

* **Generation Folders**: The root of the branch contains a directory for each generated dataset, named in the format `gen<num>` (e.g., `gen1`, `gen8`).

* **`index.json`**: Inside each `gen<num>` folder, you will find a top-level `index.json` file. This file contains metadata about the dataset (like the generation number and creation date) and provides complete summary lists for all data points within that generation.

* **Data Subdirectories**: Each generation folder also contains the following subdirectories, which hold the detailed JSON files for each data point:
    * `/ability`
    * `/form`
    * `/item`
    * `/move`
    * `/pokemon`

## Use as a Static API
