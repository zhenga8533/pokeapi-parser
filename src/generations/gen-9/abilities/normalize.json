They otherwise work as usual, however; weather ball, for example, is always forced to be Normal, but it still has doubled power and looks different during weather.\n\nAs thunder wave is prevented by immunities, unlike most non-damaging moves, it does not affect ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon under the effect of this ability.",
