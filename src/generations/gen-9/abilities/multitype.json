Covet, Thief, and Knock Off still inflict damage against this Pok\u00e9mon.  Unlike with sticky hold, this Pok\u00e9mon cannot use fling, Switcheroo, or Trick to lose its item itself, nor gain an item through Switcheroo or Trick if it does not have one.\n\nThis ability has no effect for any Pok\u00e9mon other than arceus.  This ability cannot be traded with skill swap, nor copied with role play or trace, nor disabled with gastro acid, nor changed with worry seed.  This Pok\u00e9mon cannot use Skill Swap or Role Play to lose its ability itself.  mold breaker cannot ignore this ability.\n\nIf a Pok\u00e9mon Transforms into an Arceus with this ability, it will Transform into Arceus's default, normal-type form.  If the Transforming Pok\u00e9mon is holding a Plate, this ability will then activate and change the Pok\u00e9mon into the corresponding form.",
